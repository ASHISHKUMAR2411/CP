#include<iostream>
// using namespace is not good practice as it has huge  library where it has lot of definition as so makes it difficult and takes times 
// we use diiferent mathods to avoid that 
// for example
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
// for input
// typedef std::cin in;
// int a,b;
//     in >> a >> b;
// out<<"Ashish Kumar";
int main()
{
    int a;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Ashish Kumar "<<a;
    return 0;
