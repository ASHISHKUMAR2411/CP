// As we know endl and \n works almost the same thing that is add newline to it but endl do something more that is it also insert to flushes the stream i.e the cin or cout stream ends there .
// endl is manipulator and \n is character 
// endl doesnt occupy memory but \n occupy memeory ,
// \n can be used inside the string as it will works as what is assign for i.e is \n  but endl is keyword so it will not be as used as it function inside string .
