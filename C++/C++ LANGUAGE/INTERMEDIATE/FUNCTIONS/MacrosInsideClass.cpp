/* Readers familiar with the C language knows that C language uses macro. The preprocessor replace all macro calls directly within the macro code. It is recommended to always use inline function instead of macro. According to Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup the creator of C++ that macros are almost never necessary in C++ and they are error prone. There are some problems with the use of macros in C++. Macro cannot access private members of class. Macros looks like function call but they are actually not.

/* C++ compiler checks the argument types of inline functions and necessary conversions are performed correctly. Preprocessor macro is not capable for doing this. One other thing is that the macros are managed by preprocessor and inline functions are managed by C++ compiler.

Remember: It is true that all the functions defined inside the class are implicitly inline and C++ compiler will perform inline call of these functions, but C++ compiler cannot perform inlining if the function is virtual. The reason is call to a virtual function is resolved at runtime instead of compile time. Virtual means wait until runtime and inline means during compilation, if the compiler doesnâ€™t know which function will be called, how it can perform inlining?

One other thing to remember is that it is only useful to make the function inline if the time spent during a function call is more compared to the function body execution time. An example where inline function has no effect at all: */
