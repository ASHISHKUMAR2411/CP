// ? Efficiency of an algorithm depends on two parameters:

//* 1. Time Complexity

//* 2. Space Complexity

//* 1. Time Complexity:-
// Time Complexity: Time Complexity is defined as the number of times a particular instruction set is executed rather than the total time is taken. It is because the total time taken also depends on some external factors like the compiler used, processorâ€™s speed, etc.


//* 2. Space Complexity:-
// Space Complexity: Space Complexity is the total memory space required by the program for its execution.

// ?One important thing here is that in spite of these parameters the efficiency of an algorithm also depends upon the nature and size of the input.
