que)  -> Which sorting algorithm will take least time when all elements of input array are identical?

Ans  -> The insertion sort will take O(n) time when input array is already sorted. 



Points To Remember
-> HEapSorting    SelectionSort    InsertionSort    MergeSort 


-> Selection sort makes O(n) swaps which is minimum among all sorting algorithms mentioned above.

-> Merge and heap has O(n*logn)sorting algorithms has the lowest worst-case complexity.

-> Selection Sort is an in-place algorithm having minimum number of swaps. It works on greedy approach and takes O(n) swaps to sort the array of n elements.


->MergeSort is preferred over QuickSort for Linked Lists


// Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays
