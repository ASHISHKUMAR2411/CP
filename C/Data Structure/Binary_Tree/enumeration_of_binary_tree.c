// in this we will see how we can generate differnt types of trees and do manipulation in there
// they are of two types we
// 1. labelled tree
// 2. Unlabelled tree

// in labelled tree we labell the nodes with specific value and there are many possibilities for the generation of the lebelled trees 
// there is a formula for the counts of such possiblities if we are provided the number of the nodes lets say that is n 
// number of possibilties : (2n)!/(n+1)!

// in unlabelled tree we can also generate the different tree posibilties 
// the number of such possibilties are:(2n)!/(n+1)!(n)! where n is the number of the nodes available .
