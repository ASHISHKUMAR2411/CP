// Hashing is best in which we search, delete and insert elements in O(1) time.

// In hashing, if store values based on hash function, then we can search, delete and insert elements in O(1) time.

// In hashing we store keys based on hash function.

// In we if we don't know about keys then we can have collisions.

// In hashing we can have collisions.

//? Method to Handle Collision 

//! To deal with collisions we use separate chaining and open addressing.

//! 1) In separate chaining we use linked list or Dynamic Array and AVL tree self balancing BST.

//! 2) In open addressing we use linear probing and quadratic probing.

//* Linear probing - we use linear probing. 
// What is linear Probing
//* Quadratic probing -  we use quadratic probing.
//* Double Hashing -
